					<h1>What is DevMountain?</h1>
					<span>DevMountain is a 12-week intensive training in an intimate class and lab setting. Class is after hours every week, but class is just the beginning. We teach professional web development using modern tactics. We believe in hands on learning, and engaging students.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>What can I expect from the course?</h1>
					<span>Expect an intense, focused, and fun learning experience. You will be spending 20-30 hours a week coding, testing, reviewing, and shipping code. You’ll work alongside peers. You’ll be guided by expert mentors. You’ll produce something you’re proud of. And you’ll be ready for the next step in your career.</span>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>What will the schedule be?</h1>
					<span>The finalized schedule depends on which time of year you attend. The fall course will begin September 7th and end in December. Classes will be held 3 weeknights with 1 weekend session per week.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>When does it start?</h1>
					<span>Fall orientation is Tuesday September 3rd. The fall semester begins September 10th and runs for 12 weeks. Applications for Fall 2013 need to be submitted by August 15th. The Dev Mountain selection process will start the day after applications close.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>So I'm going to be sitting in class for 4 days a week?</h1>
					<span>No. That is boring and ineffective. Little time is spent listening to lectures, and a lot of the time practicing what you learn. Most work is done in pairs and small groups. This is the best way to solve problems, tackle challenges, and build applications until you're confident in your mastery of the skills. Just remember, class is 4 nights a week, but we expect you to be spending alot more time than that!
					</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>Do I have what it takes to be accepted?</h1>
					<span>Chances are, we are looking for people like you. People who are passionate about learning technology, excited about a career as a software developer, and genuinely driven. You don't need any special super powers to be a programmer. You don't need advanced math or calculus. It's not dark magic, it's a language, a way of thinking. People who tell you otherwise, ignore them.

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>How many people will be in the class?</h1>
					<span>To maintain a great learning environment, each cohort will be limited to about 20 students with 3 dedicated teachers. DevMountains cohorts tend to run in sequence with normal University semesters.
					</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>Do I need to bring anything? A laptop?</h1>
					<span>Yes, you need a laptop. Having said that, if you have a laptop, bring it. We will provide work stations for you. At DevMountain we work on Mac OS X computers, and we recommend bringing a Mac laptop if you can, though we understand some folks may bring a Windows or Linux laptop.</span>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>What does “after hours” mean?</h1>
					<span>This means that the face-to-face sessions will occur on weeknights and weekends, so you can still potentially hold a day job or continue your school schedule. It won’t be a walk in the park, because this course will require a lot of you, but you can do it.</span>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>How much will it cost?</h1>
					<span>Unlike the high prices of similiar schools in Chicago, San Franscisco, New York, or even Salt Lake, the DevMountain introductory tuition for the class is $3,500.00. This price is valid through August 15.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>Where is DevMountain?</h1>
					<span>The course sessions will occur at Camp 4 in Provo, Utah at 560 S 100 W. The collaboration, code reviews, and some work will be on your own time and can be performed wherever you choose. Much of the success of the course depends on the hours you put into it.</span>

					<h1>Can you really become a programmer in 12 weeks?</h1>
					<span>Software engineering is a craft that takes years of deliberate practice and learning to master. Our goal is to graduate world-class beginners, and jumpstart your journey towards becoming an elite coder. Having said that, we are betting that in 12 weeks you can learn enough programming to start contributing value to an engineering team as an entry level developer, where your learning can continue on the job.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>I don't know any programming. Is that ok?</h1>
					<span>Absolutely. No previous computer science background is needed. We teach you everything from scratch. However, you do need you to be proficient with a computer. Additionally, we've found that student success is directly tied to how intently students engage with the preparatory work we provide before the program.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>Are you guaranteeing me a job?</h1>
					<span>Nope. Just a bomb! training. We want to get continuously better at preparing our students to be the best possible software developers and employees who are ready to learn and grow. Building a reputation which is attractive to employers is our goal.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h1>Are the teachers/mentors really experts?</h1>
					<span>Our team members have a wide range of backgrounds, from school degrees and multiple years of professional coding to recent graduates from our own program. We're actively developing our technical skills, but our real goal is to be awesome facilitators of learning. But to sum up the answer, yes, we have people who have previously worked at twitter.</span>
